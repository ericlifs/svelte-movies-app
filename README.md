# Svelte movies app

This project was created with learning purposes. Based on the documentation provided on [this exercise link](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/3-Advanced/Movie-App.md) I decided to develop it on sapper/svelte in order to learn and test my skills.

### Installation

However you get the code, you can install dependencies and run the project in development mode with:

```bash
cd svelte-movies-app
yarn install # or yarn
yarn dev
```

Open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start clicking around.

Consult [sapper.svelte.dev](https://sapper.svelte.dev) for help getting started.
